## Requirements

- Local copy of [postcodes.io repository](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [PostgreSQL and PostGIS](https://postgis.net/documentation/getting_started/)

### Operating System Compatibility

Currently, the install process targets Linux and macOS systems. Please let us know if you have issues on those or any other operating systems.

## Installation Steps

Postcodes.io is packaged with a script to provision PostgreSQL and download a dump of the dataset. The script will perform the following tasks:

- Prompt you for your PostgreSQL superuser credentials (most of the setup steps require this level of privilege)
- Create a new database
- Create a new readonly user for the new database
- Download, unzip and stream the `pg_dump` into the new database

To run,

```bash
$ npm run setup
```
