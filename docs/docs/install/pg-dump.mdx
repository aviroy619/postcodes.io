title: "Manual Installation `pg_dump`"

You can download a `pg_dump` of the database. This is the same dump used by the install script. The link to the latest dump can be found in our [repository](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io/blob/master/latest).

To set up the database from our `pg_dump` download, `gunzip` and use either `psql` or `pg_restore` to import the data into PostgreSQL.

For example,

```bash
$ cat postcodeiodb.sql | psql postcodesiodb
```
